# SWDreader in R
# author: Christian Richard



# TO DO:
# - Determine how to modify Morlet wavelet parameters to match LW algorithm if scale != frequency in Hz
# - Determine whether frequencies along y-axis are log(frequency) so that harmonics detection can work

library(WaveletComp)

# had to remove the LastWave header information first to get data from an EEG channel in file 35567_052213.lwr
b = file("./SWDreader//sans_header.lwr", "rb")

# this line gets the first 1440000 time points, i.e. all 2 hours of the first channel (sample rate = 200 Hz)
# then writes results to file
br = readBin(b, numeric(), 1440000)
write(data.frame(br)$br, "./SWDreader/singleChannel", ncolumns=1)

s = read.table("./SWDreader//singleChannel")

# IN CASE YOU GET ERROR "Error in plot.new() : figure margins too large"
# JUST DO par(mfrow=c(1))

# TESTING - this region contains 4 SWDs
s.sub = s$V1[400000:450000]
s.sub = data.frame(s.sub)
my.w = analyze.wavelet(s.sub, loess.span=0, dt=1, dj=1/10)

# TO PLOT TIME SLICE OF TIME-FREQUENCY REPRESENTATION OF POWER
# plot(my.w$Power[1:131,21000], type="l")

# TO GET SUBSET OF TIME-FREQUENCY REPRESENTATION OF POWER
# mx = as.matrix(my.w$Power[1:131,20000:20400])
